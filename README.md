## ✨ What is Ngawasin?

**Ngawasin** is a lightweight web application that combines a real-time clock with persistent notes.
It was originally created to help me display both time and notes conveniently during lab supervision or exam proctoring sessions.

Since [time.is](https://time.is) can’t be customized with the additional features I needed — and because I often found myself juggling too many windows (like Notepad and a browser) during each session, I decided to build this site to combine all those essential tools into one place.

Beyond that, this app can also be useful for general time tracking or note taking alongside a live clock. For example, when studying, running events, or managing tasks.

**Note:** This project is actively evolving. New features and improvements are planned as development continues.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyvos07/ngawasin.git
cd ngawasin

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see the app running.

## 🎯 Usage

### Default Mode
Navigate to `/` for a clean clock and notes interface.

### Brainrot Mode
Navigate to `/brainrot` for the same features with an accompanying endless minecraft parkour.

## 📝 Future Plans

Some future plans on what I will add:
- Progress bar instead of usual clock, to act as a timer with a real-time clock
- A full clock only mode
- **[Niche Feature]** Score leaderboard, since I mainly need this site in a programming contest/lab session that use an online grader.
